An alternative to typing notes. It will support high speed note taking alongside other features such as 'review', 'voice snippets' and 'support images'. This has great use cases in school, university or even corporate meetings. 

Feel free to contact me if you've got any tips, new features or suggestions. I'd also be happy to have you onboard if you want to help build this app.
